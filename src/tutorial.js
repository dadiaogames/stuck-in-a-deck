export const TUTORIAL = `Welcome to Stuck In A Deck!
You are stuck in a deck, which when all deck cards are played and discarded, the discard pile will become the deck again, and cards are always looping between the deck and discard.
You, as a card, need to escape from this loop!
However, here are some threads you can find about how to escape, if you Search.
(If you have played other deck building games like Dominion/Ascension/DreamQuests/SlayTheSpire, you will quickly get into this game.)

How to play:
* The goal is to get enough threads(marked with a shoe).
* To get threads, you need to Search, cost 1 power(marked with thunder), and gain threads equal to your search power(marked with a lens).
* To reinforce your deck, you may use knowledge(marked with bulb) to buy cards from shop.
* To attack a mob, cost some attack power, and deal damage equal to the attack power cost.
* The PORTAL will keep inserting new mobs into your deck, and when it inserts 4 times, a new PORTAL will be inserted into your deck, so escape as quickly as you can!
* Cards got different ways to use. Cards with no ":" in desc effect when you draw them; Cards with ":" are in format "<cost>: <effect>", some cost a power, some may discard themselves(marked with bin), and some may cost your knowledge or other powers.`;
